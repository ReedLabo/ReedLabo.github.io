<h1>Places I have traveled to</h1>
<p>Another thing that I love to do that I don't think would be considered a hobby is to travel!</p>
<p>I love getting to see and explore new environments, as well as seeing how different cultures and societies function,
I have only been out of the country several times and I hope to see a lot more in the next few years.</P>
<p>Cancun,Mexico</P>
