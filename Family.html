<h1>Family</h1>
<p>I grew up in York and have lived here my entire life with my family.</P>
<p>My mother, Melanie, owns a hair salon in Portsmouth NH.(Just a ten minute drive from our house in Maine.)</P>
<p>My father, Michael, works at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. This is a place of work for many people in the community.</p>
<p>My older brother, Kyle, has spent the last few years traveling around the country and even went backpacking in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>He is currently living in NYC at the Nomad restaurant, a very prestigious restaurant.</p>
